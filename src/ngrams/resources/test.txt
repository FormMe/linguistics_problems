Wikinews:Wikinews needs you!
Welcome all to Wikinews, the free news source written by you! Everything you read here is written by individuals just like yourself. You can edit any article — fix spelling mistakes, punctuation or grammar, correct mistakes or further expand the article!

Please note that if you have been involved in an event that you want Wikinews to report on, it may be more appropriate for you to request an interview with the Wikinews community. Requesting an interview is like holding a press conference.

What Wikinews articles are
First and foremost, Wikinews articles are written from a neutral point of view and don't contain opinion or commentary (if you want to tell the world what you think about a news item, try blogging.)

There are two main kinds of articles:

Synthesis articles - articles written using information from other online news sources. "What does that offer that I can't get from, say, Google News?", you may ask. Simple — we can combine all the facts available from all sources about a news event into a single article for the reader's convenience, and we can present the information in a neutral manner — avoiding the bias that may be present in other news sources. Furthermore, we always cite our sources so you can check our work.
Original reporting - journalism by Wikinews contributors themselves. You yourself can write the news by providing first-hand reports of a news event. We only ask that you take detailed notes and present them with your article to support your work.
All articles are a collaboration. No one person is the 'author', and everyone is free to edit any article, so long as the changes don't contravene our guidelines.

What we want from YOU!
We want you to write articles for Wikinews on topics that:

You find interesting: If it's of interest to you, it will be interesting to many other people!
You feel aren't getting adequate coverage: Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten or isn't getting enough attention in the rest of the press? Here's your chance to tell the world!
Are important to you: The news you write can be about a global event or what's happening in your local town — we don't mind!
But we also want you to edit and expand the other articles you see here. Unlike in any other news source, when you see a mistake or something you know to be incorrect, you can fix it!

OK, get me started!

On Wednesday, automobile company Volvo announced all of its cars to be released in 2019 onwards are to use some form of battery-powered engine, leaving conventional petrol-only vehicles altogether. The decision comes after Volvo announced in May their intent to cease production of diesel vehicles.

The chief executive of Volvo Cars, Håkan Samuelsson, said, "People increasingly demand electrified cars". Volvo aims to release five new electric vehicle models between 2019 and 2021. While little has yet been revealed about them, the company has stated two of them are to be high-performance electric vehicles, branded as Polestars.

Other car models from 2019 may be plug-in hybrid or 48-volt "mild hybrid" systems. Audi and Mercedes-Benz are also releasing mild hybrid cars for the European market.

"This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car. Volvo Cars has stated that it plans to have sold a total of 1m electrified cars by 2025. When we said it we meant it. This is how we are going to do it," Samuelsson said. Volvo is owned by Chinese automotive giant Geely, and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has said by 2025 they want new vehicle sales to be 20 percent "new energy vehicles".

The newest version of U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban took effect late Thursday. It bars entry to the United States from six Muslim-majority countries, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan, Iran, Libya, and Syria, and all refugees irrespective of country of origin are barred for 120 days. Iraq is no longer included. Border officials have been instructed to honor existing visas, but in general no new ones are to be issued. Although some lawyers showed up to volunteer their services, U.S. airports continued to operate smoothly, without the huge scale of protests that marked the first attempt to enforce the travel ban.

A United States Supreme Court ruling handed down Monday said the ban was legal so long as it made an exemption for anyone with "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity" already in the country. The Trump administration is counting parents, in-laws, children and step-versions of these as bona fide relationships and, at the last moment, added fiancés, but discounted grandparents, grandchildren, cousins, nieces and nephews. The attorney general of Hawaii has challenged the administration's definition of close family as too strict.

"The banning of grandmothers — of unaccompanied children — from America's shores is a disgrace," said David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee.

Under the current ruling, people with businesses or in ongoing educational programs are also allowed to enter or re-enter the country, and permanent residents of the United States are exempted. Although lower courts declared the travel ban tantamount to religious discrimination targeting Muslim-majority countries, the Supreme Court disregarded both those concerns and President Donald Trump's tweets about his plans to bar Muslims from entering the United States. They declared instead the President has "a compelling need to provide for the nation's security" that includes the right to control immigration. The Supreme Court is to give the travel ban more in-depth consideration when it reconvenes this coming October.

On Sunday, a long-distance snapshot of New Jersey governor and former Republican United States presidential candidate Chris Christie and his family on a beach outside the gubernatorial residence in Island Beach State Park went public, raising criticism of the governor, who had ordered Island Beach and the rest of New Jersey's state parks closed the previous Friday amid a budget dispute. The response included comments from fellow Republicans and tourists, a plane over Seaside Park, and a variety of memes showing the Governor's beach chair digitally added to other images.


Chris Christie in 2015

"[Christie's] rise to national prominence was that he had this reputation as a fighter, and that when he was fighting he was on the side of the Everyman and the New Jersey taxpayer against the status quo," Republican political strategist Kevin Madden offered. "I think the danger of the photos is that it undermines that."

Christie's lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, said, "If I were governor, I sure wouldn't be sitting on the beach if taxpayers didn't have access to state beaches. We need to end the shutdown now. It's hurting small businesses and ordinary New Jerseyans." Guadagno is planning to run for governor.

One visitor to Atlantic City, New Jersey — Matt Jenkins — told the press, "I think it's a shame, it's hideous."

Regardless of whether they shared Jenkins' opinion, users of Photoshop and similar programs added the Governor in his beach gear to images of television programs such as Jersey Shore and The Sopranos, movies like Jaws, and one scene from the Oval Office.

On Monday, a plane towed a banner over Seaside Park reading, "Tell Gov Christie: Get the hell off Island Beach State Park," echoing the Governor's own words in 2011, in which he told visitors "Get the hell off the beach" as Hurricane Irene approached. The plane received applause from beachgoers.

The dispute that precipitated the shutdown concerned a law letting the New Jersey state government decide how much money the state-founded health insurer Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey would be allowed to accumulate before being required to contribute to the New Jersey state health fund passed the state Senate but not the House, which is largely made up of Democrats. Governor Christie supported the bill. On Sunday, he told the press he would sign any budget the legislature sent him so long as the bill is passed as well: "If they send it to me with Horizon, I will sign it. If they send it to me without Horizon I will use my authority to make a smaller budget[...] If they send me a budget today the shutdown would be over. The Legislature is deciding not to send me either budget." The smaller budget that the governor proposed would include less funding for schools and other programs. Late Monday, the state legislature complied with the governor's stipulations, and Governor Christie signed the bill, reopening the state's parks in time for the Fourth of July holiday.

Christie enjoyed an approval rating of roughly 70% after his response in 2012 to Hurricane Sandy, but his popularity suffered following a 2016 scandal called Bridgegate, in which some of his aides ordered some of the entry lanes into the George Washington Bridge, a major artery for the commute from New Jersey into New York City, closed during rush hour, possibly as political retaliation against a politician in Fort Lee, New Jersey, the town most potently affected by the closure. He also lost the Republican presidential nomination to now-President Donald Trump and the vice presidential nomination to Mike Pence.

Christie defended his decision not to cancel his family's vacation plans by pointing out that many of New Jersey's beaches, over 100 miles (160 km) remained open to visitors and saying that he has the right to use the gubernatorial residence and that his visit required no government services. The Guardian noted a state helicopter shuttled the governor between the park and the state capital, Trenton.

New Jersey is one of several U.S. states that did not have budgets ready for the fiscal year. The northeastern state of Maine also underwent a government shutdown.

Former Chelsea and England's football captain John Terry signed a one-year contract with Aston Villa on a free transfer, the club announced on Monday. In April, the 36-year-old defender announced his desire to leave his boyhood club, Chelsea, after his contract ended with the London-based club.

John Terry joined the Blues 22 years ago, and made his professional debut against Aston Villa in 1998. Since then, Terry has won fifteen trophies making 717 appearances for Chelsea. The only players who made more appearances for Chelsea were Ron Harris and Peter Bonetti. He has won the Premier League and FA Cup five times, EFL (English Football League) Cup thrice, and one each of UEFA Champions League and Europa League. Terry led Chelsea to the Premier League title in his final season.

Terry said he did not want to play against Chelsea, and hence joined Aston Villa, who are in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. He said, "The mental side of playing against Chelsea was too much to get over for me. I was there for 22 years at the football club. I am very proud of that but this is a new chapter in my life and career."

After signing the contract, Terry said, "My thoughts are 100% here and the ambition is to get us back to the Premier League. It's a huge club." Terry has been assigned jersey number 26, the number he wore on his back in his entire professional career. His contract with Chelsea expired on Friday.

On Friday, the Bundestag, the German parliament, voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The bill was passed on the last day before the parliament's summer break.

With 393 members voting for legalising same-sex marriage, four members abstained leaving 226 against votes. German chancellor Angela Merkel, on June 26, said she would allow parliamentarians to vote their own conscience, and Martin Schulz of the Social Democratic Party, on the next day, asked for voting before the election in September.

"I hope that the vote today not only promotes respect between the different opinions but also brings more social cohesion and peace", Merkel said. She voted against same-sex marriage, she told the media, explaining she believed the German constitutional definition of marriage required a man and a woman.

"Marriage for all is decided. Thus, there is unity and justice and freedom in Germany now for all who love." ((de))  , Schulz tweeted. After the voting, Germany's capital football club Hertha Berlin tweeted "For diversity and against discrimination" ((de))  , and hoisted the rainbow-coloured flag — a symbol of the LGBT community.

Civil partnership has been legal in Germany since 2001, but this bill awaits the president's signature to enter the lawbooks. Other countries in Europe where same-sex marriage is legal include Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Ireland, and the whole of the United Kingdom except Northern Ireland.

On Wednesday, the lower house of the Czech Republic's parliament voted in favour of expanding legal firearms possession, asserting safety of the state and citizens. 139 of 168 deputies voted to amend the Czech constitution, allowing firearms possession previously banned under European Union (EU) orders.

Per the amendment, citizens can legally obtain guns, and carry them for the security of the country during militant attacks. Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said, "We do not want to disarm our citizens at a time when the security situation in Europe is getting worse" in Wednesday's parliamentary debate. The EU reformed the gun law in December, prohibiting citizens from possessing short semi-automated arms with more than 20 rounds, and long semi-automated arms with more than ten rounds. The rule was enacted in April; the Czech Republic, Poland, and Luxembourg opposed it.

The EU's decision to call for stricter law for firearms came after the Paris attack in November 2015, and explosions at Brussels' airport and subway system in March 2016. Chovanec said, "Show me a single terrorist attack in Europe perpetrated using a legally-owned weapon." The amendment waits for the approval of the senate and the president. The Czech government is to lodge a complaint against the EU's orders in the European Court of Justice by August 17.

In recent years, unlike the Czech Republic, European countries including the United Kingdom, France and Belgium suffered militant attacks. Last year's Global Peace Index listed the Czech Republic sixth in the safest countries.

On Wednesday, thousands of citizens gathered in New Delhi's Jantar Mantar and other cities across India to protest against mob violence against minority communities of Muslims and Dalits, which has increased in recent years. Documentary film-maker Saba Dewan asked for "protest against the lynchings" via a Facebook post on June 24, after a teenage Muslim boy, Junaid Khan, and his brothers were reportedly racially abused, and Junaid allegedly stabbed and killed by a mob, after a dispute last week in Haryana.

About 2000 people gathered for the protest — Not in my Name — in the Indian capital, while several others protested in Bombay, Allahabad, Lucknow, Patna, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Thiruvananthapuram, Chandigarh, Kochi, and Jaipur. There were protests held in London as well. The protests came after several instances where people were killed due to mob violence, the victims mostly from the minority communities of Muslims and Dalits. Protesters held placards with messages such as "No Place for Islamophobia", "Break the Silence", and "Shed Hate not Blood". Saba Dewan said, "the protest is against this systematic violence against Muslims and Dalits that is going on in our country at the moment". The protesters presented poems, songs and danced on stage on the Jantar Manter to express their views. Manish Sisodia, New Delhi's deputy chief minister, also took part in the protest. In Bombay, protesters were permitted till 7 PM.

"Shouldn't there be protests against the lynchings especially after the murder yesterday in Delhi NCR by a mob of a 16 year old Muslim boy? If not now then when? Why wait for political formations to organize a demonstration ? Why can't all of us as citizens repulsed by the violence get together in protest at the earliest next week at Jantar Mantar under the banner - Not in my Name", Dewan posted on Facebook.

Junaid's brother Hasseem said the people "were pointing at a packet which had food and saying we should not be allowed to sit since we were carrying beef" even though he told they were not carrying beef. The mob, reportedly threw Junaid's skull cap, and called them "beef eaters" and "anti-nationalists". About twenty people were involved in the violence. One man, who was held for the violence told NDTV he was "told by his friends to attack the Muslim boys because they ate beef". Police arrested four people on Wednesday accused for the violence, police superintendent Kamaldeep Goel told the Press Trust of India.

There have been several instances where people were harassed or killed due to mob violence. At least ten Muslims have been reported victims of the mob violence in the past two years, for beef consumption or transporting cows. Cow is considered sacred in Hinduism and many Hindus in the country view cow as a god or mother. Beef is banned in several states of India and a person found guilty for killing a cow can face a prison term up to ten years. But often, the "gau rakshaks" (cow protectors) have taken the law in their hands and lynched the accused. Some of the claims turned out to be false.

Though India is a secular state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which shares Hindu nationalist views, vowed to ban beef across India. In 2015, ex-Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said, "Do I assault everyone who eats pork or alcohol?" after Rashid Ahmed was beaten by BJP members for serving beef in a private party. Pork and alcohol are considered haram and hence, their consumption is prohibited in Islam.

"Killing people in the name of 'gau bhakti' [cow devotion] is not acceptable", Modi said yesterday.
