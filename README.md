## Computational linguistics

Welcome to the main page of my project! This repository stores simple examples of linguistics problems.

My name is Daria, I'm software engineer with skills in natural language processing. My general scientific interests are knowledge bases and facts extraction. There are very important analysis tools that provides semantic analysis and text mining.

Project has next sections:
* [Morphology](#morphology)
* [Knowledge engineering](#knowledge-engineering)
* [N-grams applications](#n-grams-applications)
* [Games](#games)

In the source code three languages is supported now: English, Russian and Finnish. I hope that very soon next publishing problems will implement NLP-algorithms for more languages.

Source code:

#### Morphology
- [Russian patronymic generator](src/russian/Patronymic-ya.py)
